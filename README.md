# UWPToyVpn
UWPToyVpn is a sample application that shows how to build a VPN client using the [Windows.Networking.Vpn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/Windows.Networking.Vpn) class.

It was inspired by Android's [ToyVpn](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/development/+/master/samples/ToyVpn).

The server-side implementation is compatible with [ToyVpn's](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/development/+/master/samples/ToyVpn/server/linux).
